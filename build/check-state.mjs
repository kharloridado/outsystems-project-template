/* check-state.mjs — structural guard for loop/state.json and the findings register.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `check-stylesheets.mjs` was written because a conflict boundary fell
 * inside a CSS rule three times and silently deleted a section. This is the same story in
 * a different file, and it has now happened three times too:
 *
 *   1. A maker minted FND-033..036 at build time while another branch had already
 *      committed 033 and 034 for different findings. Ten citations shipped in six files.
 *   2. Merge c85f283 took main's state.json and re-applied the pat-top-menu-bar ITEM but
 *      not its four findings[] entries. Four findings were silently deleted and the loss
 *      shipped to main in da14ac3. It was caught by hand, days later, and only because
 *      somebody happened to read the entries back while allocating IDs.
 *   3. FND-035..038 were then filed correctly — IDs taken at filing time, not build time —
 *      and STILL collided, because cmp-table and cmp-overlays filed in parallel between
 *      the counter being read and the branch being pushed. Renumbered to 045..048.
 *
 * `state.json` is the one file every item writes and NOTHING READS. Not the build, not the
 * gate, not the checker. That is exactly why these went unnoticed: a corrupted stylesheet
 * eventually renders wrong, whereas a dropped findings entry produces no symptom at all.
 * Case 2 nearly cost a real finding — FND-047 is the same defect as issue #54 reached from
 * the opposite direction, and had it stayed lost, #54 would have been the only record and
 * would have read as a screen bug rather than a header one.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT DO. It cannot stop two branches allocating the same ID in parallel; only
 * a lock or a merge queue can, and neither is worth it here. Taking IDs at filing time
 * narrows the window. This catches the collision at the merge, which is the next best
 * thing and is where all three were actually detectable.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node build/check-state.mjs            # invariants + "nothing disappeared" vs HEAD
 *                                         # (and vs MERGE_HEAD when mid-merge)
 *   node build/check-state.mjs --no-git   # invariants only
 *
 * Runs in CI and before build:theme, alongside check:config and check:stylesheets. */
